# Installation

`reip` is currently written with Python 3.6 or later, but I am hoping to make it compatible with 3.4 of lower when I get a chance.

We will not support Python 2.7. 2.7 is dead. ;p

```bash
pip install reip
```

This installs the packages required for `reip` core and its core blocks. For instructions on modality specific installation see:
 - [Audio](Audio.md)
 - [Video](Video.md)

## Jetson Nano

#### pyarrow
